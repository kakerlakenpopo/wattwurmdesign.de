description
the goblet is made to be used in a church. It can be either used for wine or bread. 
The design is more simple and less old an golden to bring the ne time also to the church. 
Old goblets are usually golden with valuable stones and decorative lines. 
I wanted to give a more simple, modern but also fancy look to a traditional piece.

process
The goblet is made from copper. It was heated before hammering it into the shape. 
After molding it, it was burned again to create a pattern. The stem is polished to provide contrast.

experience
At first the words were quite difficult. But in the end it was fun to create something I would not usually design.
